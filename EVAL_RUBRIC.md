# EVAL_RUBRIC

Council scoring rubric, thresholds, veto rules.

## Review mode scoring (paper/project)
Each persona issues its own overall score (X/10) aligned with APSR-level expectations.
Score anchors:
- 9-10: field-shaping contribution, clear logic, credible design/evidence, minimal revisions.
- 7-8: strong, publishable with major revisions; clear contribution and defensible design.
- 5-6: promising but significant weaknesses in theory/design/evidence.
- 3-4: incremental, unclear contribution, or weak methodological foundation.
- 1-2: not viable at APSR standards.

Verdict mapping:
- 8-10: Revise
- 5-7: Major Revise
- 1-4: Reject
Review mode is method-agnostic and does not require breakthrough-level contributions; lane and breakthrough fields do not apply.
Persona-specific scope should be respected; cross-domain critiques only when fatal to core claims.

## Scoring scale (1-10)
- 9-10: field-shaping, credible design, unusually clear stakes
- 7-8: strong, publishable in top field outlets if executed well
- 5-6: promising but material weaknesses or unclear stakes
- 3-4: incremental, unclear, or weak design logic
- 1-2: not viable for this mission

## Required scores (idea mode; PI shortlist defaults)
- Novelty/agenda-setting: >= 8
- Theoretical stakes clarity: >= 7
- Design credibility: >= 8
- Data feasibility: >= 6 (lower allowed only if payoff is enormous and risks are explicit)
- Interpretability (measurement/construct): >= 7 where relevant
- Lane Fit: >= 7
- Breakthrough Plausibility: >= 8

## Evaluation fields (required for idea council memos)
1) Novelty/agenda-setting
2) Theoretical stakes clarity
3) Design credibility
4) Data feasibility
5) Interpretability (measurement/construct) where relevant
6) Lane Fit (explicit match to lane core puzzle + bottleneck)
7) Breakthrough Plausibility (likelihood the idea could reorient debate)
8) Overall verdict (short, use: accept / revise / reject)

## Veto rules (idea mode)
- Novelty < 8 is presumed outside mission unless PI override.
- Design credibility < 7 is an automatic reject at Gate 4.
- Lane Fit < 7 is an automatic reject at Gate 1 unless re-laned.
- Breakthrough Plausibility < 7 requires explicit revision plan; < 6 is reject.

## Notes for council agents
- Anchor scores to the lane's core puzzle and stated breakthrough type.
- Do not reward execution complexity; score design credibility only.
- Penalize any idea that lacks falsifiable predictions or a clear kill criterion.
