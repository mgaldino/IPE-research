# BACKLOG

Idea pool with tags and rejection reasons.

## Product backlog
- Add stricter council scoring guidance (complete score coverage, tougher scoring scale).
- Ensure council memos always include full rubric scores (not just Lane Fit / Breakthrough).

### IDEA-001 Payment Rail Dependence and Coercion Credibility
- Lane: Financial Statecraft and Monetary Power
- Breakthrough type: New Measurement + New Identification Path
- Design family: DiD / SCM (country-level exposure to payment network changes)
- Big claim: Payment rail dependence is a coercion amplifier independent of trade exposure.
- Novelty: Constructs a non-circular exposure index and tests coercion vs selection using exogenous payment shocks.
- Status: proposed

### IDEA-002 Enforcement Shocks and Sanctions Substitution Networks
- Lane: Sanctions, Enforcement, and Evasion Ecosystems
- Breakthrough type: New Identification Path
- Design family: DiD (firm/sector outcomes around enforcement intensity shocks)
- Big claim: Enforcement intensity, not sanctions issuance, drives evasion architecture and substitution.
- Novelty: Uses enforcement shocks (staffing/budget or secondary sanctions expansions) to isolate bite.
- Status: proposed

### IDEA-003 Chokepoint Disruptions and Strategic Interdependence
- Lane: Global Production Networks, Chokepoints, and Strategic Interdependence
- Breakthrough type: New Domain Generalization
- Design family: SCM / DiD (sector outcomes around chokepoint disruptions)
- Big claim: Network position determines whether chokepoints create leverage or vulnerability.
- Novelty: Compares multiple chokepoints with a shared network exposure metric.
- Status: proposed

### IDEA-004 IMF Conditionality Credibility vs Backlash
- Lane: Debt, IMF Conditionality, and Crisis Politics
- Breakthrough type: New Identification Path
- Design family: SCM (program entry and reform trajectories)
- Big claim: Conditionality raises reform credibility only under specific domestic coalition structures.
- Novelty: Leverages policy regime shifts as quasi-exogenous breaks in conditionality expectations.
- Status: proposed

### IDEA-005 Alignment Ideal Points from Sanctions Coalition Behavior
- Lane: Measurement of Alignment, Influence, and Dependence (Latent Traits / Ideal Points)
- Breakthrough type: New Measurement
- Design family: Ideal points (coalition participation and abstentions)
- Big claim: Alignment is better captured by enforcement participation than votes alone.
- Novelty: Builds a latent alignment measure from enforcement choices, with agenda control handling.

### IDEA-006 Measuring LIO Breakdown: From Contestation Claims to Observable Indicators
- Lane: Institutions Under Rivalry: Rules, Dispute Settlement, and Regime Fragmentation
- Breakthrough type: New Measurement
- Design family: Ideal points (latent contestation and alignment dimensions)
- Big claim: A non-circular breakdown index can adjudicate rival LIO decline theories.
- Novelty: Turns LIO contestation claims into an explicit measurement framework with validation logic.
