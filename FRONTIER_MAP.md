# FRONTIER_MAP

Living frontier review of IPE debates and bottlenecks.

## Stuck debates and why they are stuck
- Financial statecraft and monetary power: Effects of payments dominance on coercion vs self-selection into exposure; bottleneck is measuring exposure to payment rails and separating coercion from risk sorting.
- Sanctions effectiveness and evasion ecosystems: Do sanctions work via financial choke points or via trade substitution; bottleneck is hidden networks, strategic reporting, and endogeneity of enforcement intensity.
- Supply chain interdependence and leverage: Whether dependencies create leverage or vulnerability; bottleneck is mapping upstream dependencies and identifying exogenous shocks to the network.
- Industrial policy and domestic coalitions: Do domestic winners drive trade regime shifts or do governments lead with geopolitical aims; bottleneck is separating policy intent from economic fundamentals and timing of shocks.
- Technology controls and innovation trajectories: Do export controls slow rivals or accelerate substitution; bottleneck is measurement of technology exposure and credible counterfactuals for innovation paths.
- Debt, IMF conditionality, and crisis politics: Does conditionality increase reform credibility or deepen domestic backlash; bottleneck is crisis endogeneity and selective program participation.
- Energy transition and critical minerals: Does energy transition rewire alliances and supply security; bottleneck is anticipatory investment and policy endogeneity.
- Institutions under rivalry: Are rules enforced when great power rivalry intensifies; bottleneck is disentangling strategic adaptation from institutional constraints and forum shopping.
- Tax, illicit flows, and regulatory arbitrage: Do global tax rules reduce capital flight or re-route it; bottleneck is hidden flows and lack of credible counterfactuals.
- Measurement of alignment and dependence: What latent dimensions capture alignment without circularity; bottleneck is agenda control, missingness, and interpretability of latent traits.

## Candidate shocks and institutions for causal designs
- Financial statecraft: SWIFT cutoffs, sanctions on central banks, and payment network policy changes; unit is country or bank; design candidates: DiD or SCM.
- Sanctions and enforcement: Sudden tightening of secondary sanctions enforcement, new sanctions regimes, or enforcement staffing changes; unit is firm or sector; design candidates: DiD.
- Supply chain chokepoints: Port shutdowns, canal blockages, or new export restrictions; unit is firm or industry; design candidates: DiD or SCM.
- Industrial policy: Policy rollouts such as CHIPS Act, IRA, EU IPCEI approvals; unit is region or sector; design candidates: DiD or Shift-Share.
- Tech controls: Export control list expansions, licensing thresholds; unit is firm or technology class; design candidates: DiD.
- Debt and IMF: Sudden changes in IMF policy frameworks, new debt relief initiatives; unit is country; design candidates: SCM.
- Energy transition: Major subsidy changes or grid policy reforms; unit is region or industry; design candidates: DiD or Shift-Share.
- Institutions under rivalry: WTO appellate body shutdown, creation of new dispute panels or arbitration pathways; unit is dispute or member; design candidates: DiD.
- Regulatory arbitrage: Implementation of minimum tax rules or automatic exchange of information; unit is country or sector; design candidates: DiD.

## Underused behavioral datasets for ideal points
- UNGA votes with issue coding and abstentions; good for alignment dynamics but requires agenda control handling.
- WTO dispute initiation and third-party participation as revealed preference on trade rules.
- IMF program approvals, waivers, and compliance decisions as behavior from executive boards.
- OECD or IO committee votes where available (standards, tax, investment screening).
- Regional development bank lending votes where recorded (alignment and dependence signals).
- Sanctions coalition participation lists over time as revealed preference in enforcement alignment.
- Export control coordination lists and multilateral control regime updates as alignment signals.

## Priority gaps to resolve next
- A practical exposure metric for payment network dependence that is not circular.
- A defensible way to separate enforcement intensity from target behavior in sanctions settings.
- A supply chain mapping approach that yields credible exogenous shocks for DiD/SCM.
- A validated latent alignment dimension that is robust to agenda control and missingness.
- LIO literature assessment (query_id=2): heavy emphasis on international order/state politics, limited shift-share usage; dataset mentions cluster around IMF/WB/WTO/UNGA, suggesting room for new exposure-based designs.
